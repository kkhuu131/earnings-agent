# earnings-agent

## Project Overview

earnings-agent is a multi-agent LLM framework that analyzes earnings call transcripts to predict post-earnings stock price direction. Specialized AI agents with distinct analytical roles read the same transcript, form independent views, and debate each other before a portfolio manager makes a final prediction.

The novel contribution over existing frameworks like TradingAgents is a **reputation-weighted decision system**: each agent accumulates an accuracy score over historical backtests, and their influence on the final prediction is weighted proportionally to their track record. Agents that are consistently right carry more weight. This is validated against a backtesting framework that runs the full pipeline on historical earnings calls and measures 30-day price direction accuracy.

**This project is built from scratch** — not a fork of TradingAgents. Architecture decisions are original, though the multi-agent debate pattern is inspired by TradingAgents' researcher team structure.

## Architecture Overview

```
Data Layer
  └── SEC EDGAR API → fetch earnings call transcripts (10-Q/10-K filings)
  └── yfinance → fetch historical price data for backtesting

Agent Pipeline (LangGraph graph)
  └── Analyst Team (parallel)
        ├── FundamentalsAnalyst  — reads financials, revenue, margins, guidance
        ├── SentimentAnalyst     — reads tone, management confidence, language signals
        └── TechnicalAnalyst     — reads pre-earnings price action and momentum
  └── Researcher Team (sequential debate)
        ├── BullResearcher       — argues for upside, challenges bear
        └── BearResearcher       — argues for downside, challenges bull
  └── PortfolioManager           — reads all reports, makes final prediction

Output
  └── Structured JSON prediction: { direction, confidence, reasoning, agent_reports }
  └── Stored in PostgreSQL for backtesting

Backtesting Framework
  └── Runs pipeline on historical earnings calls
  └── Compares prediction to actual 30-day price movement
  └── Updates agent accuracy scores in DB
  └── Reputation weights recomputed after each backtest run

Frontend (React/Next.js)
  └── Run analysis on a ticker
  └── Watch agent debate in real time (streamed)
  └── Backtest results dashboard with per-agent accuracy over time
  └── Historical prediction log
```

## Agent Roles

Each agent receives the transcript and returns a structured JSON report before the debate begins.

### FundamentalsAnalyst
- Reads: revenue growth, EPS vs estimates, gross margin, guidance, capex
- Output: `{ signal: "bullish|bearish|neutral", key_points: [], confidence: 0-1 }`

### SentimentAnalyst  
- Reads: management tone, language hedging, certainty of language, Q&A defensiveness
- Output: `{ signal: "bullish|bearish|neutral", key_points: [], confidence: 0-1 }`

### TechnicalAnalyst
- Reads: pre-earnings price action (5d, 30d), RSI, volume trend, implied move vs historical
- Output: `{ signal: "bullish|bearish|neutral", key_points: [], confidence: 0-1 }`

### BullResearcher
- Receives: all three analyst reports
- Role: synthesize bullish case, challenge bearish assumptions
- Engages in N debate rounds with BearResearcher
- Output: `{ argument: string, confidence: 0-1, rebuttals: [] }`

### BearResearcher
- Receives: all three analyst reports
- Role: synthesize bearish case, challenge bullish assumptions
- Engages in N debate rounds with BullResearcher
- Output: `{ argument: string, confidence: 0-1, rebuttals: [] }`

### PortfolioManager
- Receives: all analyst reports + full debate transcript
- Applies reputation weights to each agent's signal
- Makes final prediction
- Output: `{ direction: "up|down|neutral", confidence: 0-1, reasoning: string, weighted_signals: {} }`

## Novel Contribution: Reputation Weighting

Every agent has a `reputation_score` stored in the database. After each backtest:
1. Compare prediction to actual outcome (price up/down 30 days post-earnings)
2. For each agent whose signal matched the final correct prediction, increment their accuracy
3. Recompute weights: `weight = agent_accuracy / sum(all_agent_accuracies)`
4. PortfolioManager uses these weights when synthesizing the final decision

This means over time the system learns which analytical lens is most predictive for different market conditions.

## LLM Configuration

All LLM calls go through a single `LLMProvider` abstraction. Never hardcode a model — always use config.

```python
# config.py
LLM_CONFIG = {
    "provider": "anthropic",          # anthropic | openai | google | ollama
    "quick_model": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",  # for fast, cheap tasks
    "deep_model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",           # for reasoning-heavy tasks
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_debate_rounds": 2,
}
```

Switching providers should require only changing this config, not touching agent code.

## Agent Output Contract

Every agent MUST return a JSON object matching its schema. No markdown, no prose — raw JSON only. This is enforced in `base_agent.py`.

```python
# base_agent.py — all agents inherit this
class BaseAgent:
    def analyze(self, context: dict) -> dict:
        raise NotImplementedError
    
    def _call_llm(self, prompt: str, use_deep_model: bool = False) -> dict:
        # Always returns parsed JSON, raises if response is not valid JSON
        pass
```

---

## Conventions

- All LLM calls are async
- Every agent call is logged to the `predictions` table with full JSONB payload
- Never store raw LLM text — always parse to structured JSON before storing
- Debate rounds are configurable via `LLM_CONFIG["max_debate_rounds"]`
- All prices are in USD, all dates are UTC
- Use Pydantic for all API request/response validation
- Environment variables loaded via `python-dotenv`, never hardcoded

---

## Build Order

This is the sequence to follow. Do not skip ahead.

1. **Data pipeline** — `backend/data/edgar.py` and `backend/data/prices.py` working and tested
2. **Database** — schema created, SQLAlchemy models, session management
3. **Single agent** — get FundamentalsAnalyst working end to end with real transcript data
4. **All analysts** — SentimentAnalyst and TechnicalAnalyst following same pattern
5. **Debate loop** — BullResearcher and BearResearcher with configurable rounds
6. **PortfolioManager** — reads all reports, applies equal weights first (reputation comes later)
7. **LangGraph graph** — wire all agents into the graph in `earnings_graph.py`
8. **FastAPI routes** — `/analyze` endpoint that runs the full graph
9. **Backtesting runner** — run pipeline on historical data, store results
10. **Reputation system** — update agent weights based on backtest accuracy
11. **Frontend** — React dashboard, streamed debate viewer, backtest charts
12. **Polish** — README, architecture diagram, deploy

---

## Current Priority

**STARTING NOW: Step 1 — Data pipeline**

Build `backend/data/edgar.py` first:
- Takes a ticker symbol (e.g. "NVDA")
- Fetches the 10 most recent earnings call transcripts from SEC EDGAR Full-Text Search API
- Returns clean text with metadata (ticker, date, accession number)
- Handles rate limiting and errors gracefully

SEC EDGAR Full-Text Search API endpoint: `https://efts.sec.gov/LATEST/search-index?q=%22earnings+call%22&dateRange=custom&startdt=2023-01-01&enddt=2024-01-01&forms=8-K`

Then build `backend/data/prices.py`:
- Takes a ticker and a date
- Returns closing price on that date and 30 days later
- Pre-computes `actual_direction` ("up"/"down"/"neutral" with a 2% threshold)
